# A ci/cd flake for org-xetex ci [^1]

- ideas is any edit in my org file need be auto pushed here without breaking TeX formatting
1. Only for my personal use atm, others can check this, but this is not ready to be forked
2. Latex variables and org-properties here need be update
## what's done
- tables align
## note to self
- load extra.el from init
- merge the shells of org/cv/modern cv ( try subshell devshell), without breaking
- test and tune bash ci/cd. 

[^1]: mainly to do more with devshell,nix-shell, devenv,bash,elisp
